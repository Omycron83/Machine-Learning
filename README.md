# Machine-Learning
In this repository, I'm embarking on a journey into the depths of machine learning 
and pattern recognition by building my own projects, algorithm implementations, and, possibly, research ideas. 
This repository is thus a collection of all of my current projects and implementations and currently serves as more of a cloud backup than a concrete project implementation meant for collaborative work. 

I structured it into the following parts:
1. Genetic algorithms, i.e. algorithms that use mechanism inspired by the theory of evolution
2. Reinforcement Learning, i.e. algorithms that try to find an optimal policy in an environment in order to optimize some reward function
3. Supervised Learning, i.e. algorithms that try to discover the relationship between features and labels
4. Unsupervised Learning, i.e. algorithms that try to find patterns in unlabeled feature data
